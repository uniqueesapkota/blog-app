## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Running the App

To run this React + Vite app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**  
    Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, in your project directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the development server**  
    Launch the app in development mode with:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server. By default, the app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

3. **Build for production**  
    To create an optimized production build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The output will be in the `dist` folder.

4. **Preview the production build**  
    You can preview the production build locally with:
